# Data:

We provide XCAT phantom [1](both 2D slices and 3D volume), pre-learned transforms (and dictionary), and reconstructions for initialization, that were used in this paper. So you could quickly reproduce results in our paper right after running the main code of one specific method.

"axial_proj_data_maker_HU.m/fan_proj_data_maker_HU.m" is used for simulating 3D cone-beam/2D fan-beam geometry, generating corresponding (noisy) sinograms, and performing FDK(FBP) to reconstruct these simulated sinograms, etc.

# Implementation:

The codes should be run with Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox (MIRT). http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/index.html

Note that this toolbox only supports Linux/Mac. Before running the main code for reconstruction, you just need to run "setup.m" in MIRT.



# Comparison Methods:

We also provide our own implmentations of the methods for comparison in this paper: PWLS-EP[2], PWLS-DL[3].
